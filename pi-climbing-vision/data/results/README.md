# Instructions for the results directory

This directory contains the output results and generated descriptions from the climbing route analysis performed by the Raspberry Pi application.

## Contents

- **Output Images**: The images processed by the YOLO model, annotated with detected holds and volumes.
- **Grid Maps**: CSV files representing the 12x12 grid mapping of detected holds.
- **Text Files**: Descriptions generated by the LLM API, providing insights into the climbing routes based on the detected holds.

## How to Use

1. After running the `src/pi_API_test.py` script, check this directory for the results.
2. Each output file will be timestamped to avoid overwriting previous results.
3. Review the generated descriptions to understand the climbing routes and their difficulty levels.

## Important Notes

- Ensure that the `data/images` directory contains the images you want to process before running the analysis.
- The results will be saved automatically in this directory, so make sure to check back after execution.
